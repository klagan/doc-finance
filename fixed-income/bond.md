# Bond
[source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp)

- Bonds are units of corporate debt issued by companies and securitized as tradeable assets.
    
- A bond is referred to as a fixed income instrument since bonds traditionally paid a fixed interest rate (coupon) to debtholders. Variable or floating interest rates are also now quite common.
    
- Bond prices are inversely correlated with interest rates: when rates go up, bond prices fall and vice-versa.
    
- Bonds have maturity dates at which point the principal amount must be paid back in full or risk default.
