- Equity represents the value that would be returned to a company’s shareholders if all of the assets were liquidated and all of the company's debts were paid off.

- We can also think of equity as a degree of residual ownership in a firm or asset after subtracting all debts associated with that asset.

- Equity represents the shareholders’ stake in the company, identified on a company's balance sheet.

- The calculation of equity is a company's total assets minus its total liabilities, and is used in several key financial ratios such as `Return on Equity` (ROE).
