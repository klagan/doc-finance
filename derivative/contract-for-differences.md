# Contract for Differences

[source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractfordifferences.asp)

- A contract for differences (CFD) is a financial contract that pays the differences in the settlement price between the open and closing trades.
  
- CFDs essentially allow investors to trade the direction of securities over the very short-term and are especially popular in FX and commodities products.
  
- CFDs are cash-settled but use allow ample margin trading so that investors need only put up a small amount of the contract's notional payoff.
