# Non Deliverable Forward
[source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/ndf.asp)

- a way of trading in a currency that is not allowed outside of the region
  
- agreement to pay the difference of the settlement price and spot price on expiry (in native currency not foreign)

- (reminds me of a depository receipt but for FX)

- the fx is never `delivered` to the contract holder
